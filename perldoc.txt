       This script will watch the status of an IP address and notify the user
       when it has gone up or down. ip-watcher can be configured to notify the
       user when the IP address to monitor has been down or up for N number of
       checks. Additionally, this script is designed to be run as a daemon. As
       such, it will automatically fork into the background and monitor things
       from there.

       ip-watcher is also designed to log messages to the daemon syslog facil-
       ity, thus freeing up your terminal from the messages it would otherwise
       spew all over.

       To shutdown ip-watcher from the daemonized state, simply send a kill
       signal of SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGABRT, or SIGTERM. Please refrain from
       using SIGKILL, as this is usually reserved for emergency system func-
       tions, or shutdown needs and will not notify the user when it is being
       shut down.

       --help
           Show a quick bit of usage help.

       --mail-from=<email-address>
           Set the email address for the From: headers for all notifications.
           If this is not specified on the command line, it defaults to
           "ip-watcher".

       --sleep-secs=<num>
           Set the amount of time to sleep between ping checks. The default
           when this is not specified is 5 seconds. NOTE: don't set this to 0
           or you'll be very sorry. :)

       --email-delay=<num>
           Set the number of consecutive times that a ping must succeed or
           fail before the user is notified of the state change. This is use-
           ful as it helps to prevent "flapping" of notifications when a
           server is going a bit nutty. Note that setting this value too high
           can cause ip-watcher to not detect a true failure, and setting it
           too low can annoy the heck out of the owner of the email address.
           Defaults to a reasonable 5.

       --daemonize
       --no-daemonize
           Toggle whether ip-watcher should fork into the background. The
           default is to go ahead and daemonize. Note that specifying
           --no-daemonize on the command line will result in all log messages
           going to the terminal, as logging all that cruft to syslog while
           running in the foreground is mostly pointless.

       --syslogging
       --no-syslogging
           Toggle whether or not ip-watcher should log it's output to the sys-
           log or to stdout instead. This allows you to have ip-watcher run-
           ning as a daemon and yet still output log messages to your terminal
           if you need to debug something. Mostly useful to developers only.
           Defaults to syslogging, unless --no-daemonize is specified, which
           implies --no-syslogging.

       --ping=<filename>
           The fully qualified pathname to the ping utility. If this is not
           specified, ip-watcher will attempt to guess at where ping is by
           scanning the PATH environment variable. Note that this program must
           be executable by the user ip-watcher runs as, and must accept the
           -c command line parameter (count).

       +o   While running the ping command, ip-watcher will be placed into a
           sleeping state and not respond to signals. Possibly fixable through
           a refactoring of the _p_i_n_g_C_h_e_c_k_(_) subroutine to not use _s_y_s_t_e_m_(_)
           calls.

       +o   Relies upon the ping binary to do the heavy lifting work of the
           whole script. This is not portable, and should be really integrated
           into the heart of the script itself either through a CPAN module,
           or by being written directly into it.

       +o   The _f_i_n_d_P_i_n_g_(_) routine is not portable across non-POSIX architec-
           tures.

       +o   None of the signal handling routines are portable across non-POSIX
           architectures.
