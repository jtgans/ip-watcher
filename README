ip-watcher v0.1 -- Initial Release
Created by June Tate-Gans <june@theonelab.com>
Released on Friday, January 27th, 2006 at 12:04pm

ip-watcher is a script written to count the frequencies of words found
in the supplied filenames. So far, ip-watcher has been tested on the
following operating systems: 

          - Debian Linux
          - MacOS X (10.4.4, specifically)

ip-watcher requires version 5.8.6, but should (theoretically) work in
any 5.8 perl interpreter. Microsoft-based systems may not work fully
due to the intrinsic differences in signals implementations and
pathnames.

ip-watcher uses the following packages to do it's dirty work:

           - Getopt::Long
           - Mail::Mailer
           - Sys::Syslog
           - Sys::Hostname

Most of these should be available with your perl interpreter, but if
not, check with your friendly CPAN mirror. =o)

In any case, most of the documentation is available in POD form in the
ip-watcher file. In case you don't have access to perldoc (heaven
forbid), I've converted the documentation into plaintext format in the
file "perldoc.txt".

Comments, suggestions, and flames are greatly anticipated. =o)
